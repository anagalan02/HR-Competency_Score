# HR-Competency_Score
## About Dataset
### Context
Recruitment and candidate selection play a critical role in determining the success of an organization. An effective initial screening process can significantly improve the quality of the hiring pool and increase the chances of finding the right candidate for any given role. This dataset focuses on both behavioral and functional competency scores, which are essential aspects of a candidate's potential fit and contribution to the organization.

### Sources
The data in this dataset has been collected from an anonymous company's internal HR department and published in a normalized form. The dataset combines the scores from two key assessments:

1. Functional competency test: Utilized to evaluate a candidate's hard skills and domain knowledge.
2. HR behavior test: An assessment tool focused on evaluating soft or behavior skills, crucial for teamwork and adaptability within an organization.

### Young Researchers' Contribution
We were approached by a group of young researchers interested in the explainable AI (XAI) problem. They aimed to analyze HR data to understand why specific candidates were called for interviews while others were not. With their valuable input and help in preprocessing the data, we have made this dataset available for the wider research community.

### Inspiration
The inspiration behind sharing this dataset was the growing need for insights into the hiring process and the importance of selecting candidates who possess a balance of functional and behavioral competencies. With the added value of XAI research, we hope to encourage researchers and data scientists to analyze the initial screening process, build models to optimize candidate selection, explain their decisions, and uncover new insights that can enhance recruitment strategies.

The dataset can be employed for a wide range of applications, including:

1. Identifying the most significant factors in determining a candidate's eligibility for an interview.
2. Developing machine learning models to predict and explain the likelihood of a candidate being called for an interview.
3. Analyzing the balance between functional competencies and behavioral skills required for a good fit in the organization.
4. Investigating the impact of different skill combinations on the overall competency scores.
